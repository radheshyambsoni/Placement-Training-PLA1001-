Warnsdorff's Algorithm

Hamiltonian Cycle


Kruskal's Algorithm
- used to create a minimum spanning tree
    1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight. 
    2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it. 
    3. Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.
