Block swap algorithm
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Initialize A=arr[0...d-1] and B=arr[d...n-1]
1)Do the following until size of A is equal to size of Block
    a) If A is shorter, divide B into B1 and Br such tat Br is of the same length as A.
    Swap A and Br to change A B1 Br into Br B1 a.Now A is at its final place, so recur on pieces of B.

    b)If A is longer, divide A into A1 and Ar such that A1 is of same length as b
    Swap A1 and B to change A1 Ar B into B Ar A1.

Finally when A and B are of equal size,block swap them
